                <h2>Indian Cricketer</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Virat Kohli</b> ( 5 November 1988 )
                      Born and raised in New Delhi, Kohli trained at the West Delhi Cricket Academy and started his youth career with the Delhi Under-15 team. 
                      He made his international debut in 2008 and quickly became a key player in the ODI team and later made his Test debut in 2011. 
                      In 2013, Kohli reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first time. 
                      During 2014 T20 World Cup, he set a record for the most runs scored in the tournament. 
                      In 2018, he achieved yet another milestone, becoming the world's top-ranked Test batsman, making him the only Indian cricketer
                      to hold the number one spot in all three formats of the game. His form continued in 2019, when he became the first player to score 20,000 
                      international runs in a single decade. In 2021, Kohli made the decision to step down as the captain of
                      the Indian following the T20 World Cup and in early 2022 he stepped down as the captain of the Test team as well.
                     
                      In 2016, he was ranked as one of the world's most famous athletes by ESPN and one of the most valuable athlete brands by Forbes.
                      In 2018, Time magazine included him on its list of the 100 most influential people in the world. In 2020, he was ranked 66th in
                      Forbes list of the top 100 highest-paid athletes in the world for the year 2020 with estimated earnings of over $26 million.
                      Kohli has been deemed one of the most commercially viable cricketers, with estimated earnings of ₹165 crore (US$21 million) 
                      in the year 2022.
